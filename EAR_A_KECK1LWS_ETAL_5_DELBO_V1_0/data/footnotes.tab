 2 The measured thermal infrared fluxes were lightcurve-corrected to the mean 
 - optical lightcurve magnitude on the assumption that the optical and        
 - thermal-infrared lightcurves are identical.                                
 3 Lightcurve amplitude is small (0.11 mag.) and no correction is applied to  
 - the measured thermal infrared fluxes.  Lightcurve amplitude from Harris et 
 - al. (2006).  (This data set may be found on the web at

 7 Lightcurve amplitude is small (0.04-0.20 mag.) and no correction is        
 - applied to the measured thermal infrared fluxes.  Lightcurve amplitude from

10 The absolute magnitude H used to derive albeos was derived from optical    
 - observations obtained at ESO, La Silla on 2002-11-28.                      
11 Thermal models were applied only to the measurments obtained with N-band   
 - filters.                                                                   
12 The whole data set (N-band and Q-band) was used.                           
13 Lightcurve amplitude is rather small (0.30 mag.) and asteroid rotation     
 - period long (23.76 hours). No correction was thus applied to the measured  
 - thermal infrared fluxes.  Lightcurve amplitude from Harris et al. (2006).
